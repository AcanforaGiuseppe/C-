Lost Myself

Project developed after a short while in AIV - (Accademia Italiana Videogiochi)
to partecipate at the "Global Game Jam", where developers and other figures
connected to the game developers world met for create a "complete" game in the arc
of the competition's length.
Personally I have covered the role of the developer, with other 4 colleagues of accademy,
where one of them cared about the graphic aspect of the game.
Tecnologies used: Visual Studio 2019 (coded with C# language), private scolastic libraries.

Libraries needed in the project:
Aiv.Draw.1.0.0
Aiv.Fast2D.1.0.0
Aiv.Audio.0.2.2
OpenTK.3.2
NVorbis.0.8.6
